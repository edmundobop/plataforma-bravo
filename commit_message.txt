feat: Implement batch stock movements and role-based access control

This commit introduces the following features and improvements:

- **Batch Stock Movements:** Users can now add multiple stock movement items to a list and register them all in a single batch operation, improving efficiency.
- **Role-Based Access Control (UI & Backend):**
    - Non-admin users are restricted to only performing 'exit' movements. The 'entry' option is now invisible in the UI.
    - Non-admin users can no longer create or edit products. Product registration/update buttons and edit/delete options are now invisible in the UI.
    - Firestore security rules have been created (in `firestore.rules`) to enforce these restrictions on the backend, ensuring data integrity. (Note: These rules need to be deployed to Firebase for full effect.)
- **UI Enhancements:**
    - Corrected the display of product lists in the stock movement screen.
    - Restored the `_getStockStatusColor` helper function.
    - Ensured proper type handling for `currentStock` in stock movement services.
